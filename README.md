SilentCut-HDR: Restriction Enzyme Marker Designer
SilentCut-HDR is a straightforward web application designed to accelerate the screening process for CRISPR Homology Directed Repair (HDR) experiments. It automatically calculates all possible synonymous (silent) mutations within a given target sequence and identifies which of those silent changes will introduce a novel Restriction Enzyme (RE) recognition site. The application's core value is suggesting the ideal Restriction Enzyme site change within the target sequence, enabling researchers to quickly confirm successful gene integration using a simple, cost-effective RE digest of bulk-edited cells. Developed in Python, the application uses FastAPI for its web interface and relies on the robust functionality of Biopython for all sequence and enzyme calculations.
